  <h2 class="post-title">What I am doing to improve the team's delivery quality</h2>
    <div class="post-entry">
      Successful project development requires a productive and qualified team and there is always room for improvement in any team. I employ some well defined tools and strategies to 
      enhance team's performance and establish a sense of responsibility among team members. For any project, I always define the team structure with explicit responsibilities for 
      each person so that there is no room for confusion. I support the team to make proper estimation and release plan. 
      I have defined the template the for project estimation and created several templates like SRS understanding proof and process, bug investigation proof and process, 
      impact analysis document etc. I have also created basic test case writing template, the CCB process for how to handle the customer changes, template for reviewing 
      the release items review before delivery. We have regular status updates from different projects to verify that all defined processes are being followed by the team. 
      I beleive proper monitoring with defined processes can help the team to grow and ensure better quality and performance.

  <h2 class="post-title">My Projects  Philosophy</h2>
    <div class="post-entry">
      Although there is no universally acceptable set of process for successful project management, I follow certain steps to ensure project quality and timely release. 
      I believe correctly understanding the requirements and accordingly making plans and estimation based on the team's capability is of utmost importance. Next, it is required
      to make design good architecture with appropriate use of different techniques including OOP, OOD, Design pattern etc. When the project is ongoing, it is always helpful to
      define and follow proper review processes to make sure things are going as planned. This includes code review, as well as review for document, bugs, change requests etc.
      Finally, as change requests can come from client anytime in agile development, it is necessary to handle them smartly to meet commitment and establish good relationship with clients.
